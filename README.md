# 🧡 Cocina con Marcelita: *Pay tribute to your loved ones*

---

## 📖 Description

**Cocina con Marcelita** is a heartfelt web application created to preserve and share the traditional recipes of my mother, Marcela. More than just a cookbook, this platform is a tribute to the **love, wisdom, and memories passed down through cooking**.

Inspired by the concept of **Ohana** — a Hawaiian word meaning *family*, not just by blood but also by bond — this project opens the door for others to honor their own special person 👵👨‍🍳👩‍🏫, whether it’s a mother, grandmother, friend, or mentor, by sharing the **recipes they taught and the stories behind them**.
